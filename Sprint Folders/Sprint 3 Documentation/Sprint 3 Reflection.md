## Reflection

As a group, it felt like we weren't able to accomplish much during Sprint 3. This is mainly due to other classes encroaching on possible work time for this project. However, the group remains optimistic, and plan to continue working during winter break and gain back productivity during the next sprint.

## Next Sprint Goals

For the next sprint, we plan to move forward with the Sponsor's suggestion of porting this web app as a mobile application. Other plans include: connecting to a food database API, implementing an LLM for assisting in task breakdown, and possible task sharing.
