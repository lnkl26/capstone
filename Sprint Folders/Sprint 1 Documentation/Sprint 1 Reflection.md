### Chet Hefton

Implemented the base UI and navigation system. Set up the manifest.json meta data functionality. Set up the service worker progressive web app ending so that our application cahces the files and can run with no connection. Maintained trello board and bugs/bug fixes. Also created the med and logging functionalities which are still in dev but very nearly complete.

### Leann Kahal

For Sprint 1, the team's Trello board was revamped by me and another member for better usability. I would later ensure that my own tasks' statuses were updated often to let my teammates be aware of my progress. My main focus for this sprint was developing task management features, such as, task creation, completion, deletion, and viewing. Routine management functions, such as, creation and deletion, were also implemented by me. Users would be able to add existing tasks into the routine. Features implemented by me were tested to ensure they functioned correctly and met the project requirements. Other things, I prepared the sprint meeting presentation to streamline updates for our sponsor.

Overall, I am content with the work I done, but I wished I had more time to further improve the routine and task functions.

## AI as a Tool

AI was used for test case generation to prevent missing edge cases.

## Reflection

As a team, we worked rather cohesively. Everyone attended group meetings, and mostly did their tasks. There are still some communication mishaps, but we will continue to work to reduce miscommunication. 

## Next Sprint Goals

For our next sprint, the implementing a database to store user-inputted information relative to tasks/routines, food/medication, and reminders, is our highest priority. Otherwise, we will continue to iterate on our present features (productivity and food management) for an improved user experience. As a flex goal, we plan to add an in-app food database using an external API, for the next sprint.
