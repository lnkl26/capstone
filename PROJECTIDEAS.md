# **INSTRUCTIONS**

List 5 projects that you are interested in (in no order of preference). This would include any ideas that you all have.

- For each project, you need to state why you want it and what skills you bring to the project.
- If you are pitching a project, you need to be clear on what problem it solves, how it is different from existing solutions, and what features you anticipate (along with other details you feel will help Dr. Ludi understand that you are proposing).
- If you are listing ideas that you have be very clear in describing what the project is, the motivation, the platform (e.g. Android, Windows), and the types of features it will have.

# **TEAM: JJaCL**

## **PROJECT IDEAS**
### Project I-10
**Project: Food Log App**
Sponsor: Dr. Stephanie Ludi
**Project Overview**
It can be important for persons who have food allergies or suspected allergies/intolerances to keep track or at least narrow down food that may cause digestive issues. This app would not only keep track of food eaten, it would also flag foods that may be causing issues using some suggestions based on the ingredients in said foods and common allergies/intolerances. In addition to the food eaten people can log how they are feeling (which will help with the identification of issues).

**JJaCL Further Features Suggestions/Ideas**
_These are suggestions adding on to the given Project Overview._
* Calorie Counter: this would help those who are tracking their caloric intake
  * Nutrients Analysis: keeps track of all the macro/micro nutrients that the user is consuming
* Nutrition Database: food items can be manually added by the user, or the user can use their camera as a barcode scanner. Once food items are uploaded to the database, users can view nutrition value, possible allergens, and other relevant information
  * Note: with a built-in database (using user local storage), the user can use this web app offline, increasing usability 
* Recipe/Diet Plan Suggestions based on User Goals: Users will provide their health goals (losing weight, keeping weight, or gaining weight, etc.) by using an LLM, the app assistant will suggest possible food recipes or diet plans that would best fit the user goals.
  * It is likely the team will create an LLM to flag allergen/intolerances, and have it also check for other ingredients that could also illicit an allergic reaction for the user
For now, it will be a web app so users having Android/Apple/Windows OS can use it, and it will allow faster testing for the team (since we have a mix of Android and Apple users)

**JJaCL’s Motivation**
* **Problem:** Most existing apps of similar design tend to paywall certain features, which is not very accessible to those who need certain features (ex. macro/micro nutrient analysis, or allergen checking). By providing a sort of all-in-one app without locking some features behind paywalls would increase user satisfaction and user retention.
We also have strong motivation to try creating an LLM. And by implementing that goal as a Dietary Assistance, we would be able to work on this project a bit more passionately.
### Project I-14
**Project: Getting Around UNT (buildings) app - help with map, nav help**
Sponsor: Dr. Stephanie Ludi
**Project Overview**
An app to help students navigate the campus between buildings that helps with things like finding food, bus stops, parking lots, disabled accessible entrances. It would be a great feature to help show well-lit paths for those taking late night classes for example or other features you can also suggest. It would give turn by turn directions, and it needs to be accessible.

**JJaCL Further Features Suggestions/Ideas**
_These are suggestions adding on to the given Project Overview._
* Bus Schedules/Routes: an added bonus for campus navigation, since the project is listing bus stops, it should also list bus schedules and routes for students who commute via bus.

**JJaCL’s Motivation**
* **Problem:** There isn’t really any campus navigation apps that provides both campus layout and bus routes, and this would provide a multi-use tool for students that are new to the campus.
### Project I-19
**Project: App to help kids with forming habits or learning things over several days/weeks**
Sponsor: Dr. Stephanie Ludi
**Project Overview:**
It can be hard for kids to learn habits like doing their chores or to motivate them to do their music lessons. This app uses a positive way to help kids form various habits as identifying the steps needed (and reminding them at each step). This can be especially helpful with kids who need some motivation. There can be cool graphical or animations to reward each step or different milestones; also parents can insert areas where there are rewards (e.g. screen time) at different points.

**JJaCL Further Features Suggestions/Ideas**
_These are suggestions adding on to the given Project Overview._
* Minigame elements either as rewards or as part of tracking chores (such as chores as objects that can be moved into a “complete” bin for points, or minigames that demonstrate chores before actually doing them)
* A virtual pet to take care of by doing chores/lessons (potential for rewards to go towards customizing in the future)

**JJaCL’s Motivation**
* **Problem:** Children have a difficult time developing healthy habits without an intrinsic reward. We aim to fix this by providing a rewarding and interactive experience to encourage children to complete tasks over time. Mainly focusing on positive reinforcement.
### Project I-22
**Project: Assistive Task App**
Sponsor: Dr. Stephanie Ludi
**Project Overview**
For this app, you need to pitch an app that you assert will help persons with disabilities in some way (though people without disabilities can also use it). It may be for people generally or for a subgroup (e.g. Deaf/Hard of hearing community, Autism community) to be used for certain activities or scenarios. You will need to do some research on what will be useful that is not already on the market or is an improvement of what is on the market.

**JJaCL Further Features Suggestions/Ideas**
_These are suggestions adding on to the given Project Overview._
* Task-Oriented
  * Focus mode: visual/auditory countdown timer for task durations (pomodoro-style)
  * Task Break Down: assistant to help break down tasks into smaller and more digestible ones → useful for individuals with task paralysis 
  * Routines: users can create their own routines with tasks and durations or select from pre-made ones
* Accessibility Customization
  * High contrast and/or color blindness mode
  * Read aloud mode and/or voice command compatibility → narrate screen page, depending on key stroke (or mobile touch) it will determine what to say next or switch pages (something similar to an automated call system)
  * Text size & font options → useful for individuals who may have dyslexia 
* Miscellaneous
  * Mood tracker: user can log how certain tasks/routines make them feel, helping in identifying those that causes stress or satisfaction

**JJaCL’s Motivation**
* **Problem:** Many popular task management apps don’t really have users with disabilities in mind. We aim to provide an adaptive task management experience by providing useful accessibility features.
### Project I-24
**Project: An app to help parents (you pitch the app)**
Sponsor: Dr. Stephanie Ludi
**Project Overview**
For this app, you need to pitch an app that you assert will help parents in some way. It may be for parents whose kids are of a certain age (e.g. babies) and in a particular context. You will need to do some research on what will be useful that is not already on the market or is an improvement of what is on the market.

**JJaCL Further Features Suggestions/Ideas**
_These are suggestions adding on to the given Project Overview._
* Logging: First-time parents can log the following things: feedings/nursing, medications, diaper changes, sleeping, and moods (quick-log template)
  * Smart Reminders: based on the logging, the app will put reminders based on logged information (i.e., “Baby has been napping for 3 hours, they should be waking up soon.”)
  * Mood Predictor: based on the logging, the app may be able to suggest possible causes of fussiness
  * Data Visualizations
    * Parents can see sleep averages, feeding durations, poop frequency, etc.
* Users Syncing
  * Both parents can have access to the baby’s information and add/edit things to the log
* First-Time Parent Encyclopedia
  * AI-powered health information and providing parenting tips
  * Parents can download/save information for later offline viewing
* Sleep tools
  * App may provide sleeping sounds (white noise)

**JJaCL’s Motivation**
* **Problem:** First-time parents are already having a lot on their plate, and other parenting apps take advantage of that by paywalling their services via subscriptions. We aim to provide a completely free, all-in-one baby care assistant.
