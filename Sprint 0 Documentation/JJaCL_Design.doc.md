***Note: this is a “living document”, meaning its content will change with the implementation of the project. Use it to capture key project concepts and document your product design and decisions. Make sure the design is traceable to the requirements. Remove/replace the blue text and the descriptive paragraphs in each section prior to your submission as directed by your instructor.  REMOVE THE ITALICIZED TEXT BEFORE SUBMISSION.***

***THIS DOCUMENT IS A STARTING POINT, YOUR TEAM IS EXPECTED TO ADD/MODIFY ALL NECESSARY SECTIONS.***

***You may use any drawing tool for your UML diagrams. If you diagrams are too big to cut and paste into this document, provide a reference to the external image files(s) \[JPG or PNG\] where they can be found or segment your image into legible sections to make them fit.***

# 

# **Class Diagram(s)**

**This is for UML class diagram capturing the relationships between classes. It is only necessary to show methods that are publically accessible by other classes. Only show an instance variable of a class if it is publically accessible**

# **ER Diagram(s)**

**This is for ER diagram capturing the structure of your database.**


# **Information Architecture Diagram**

**If your project is web-based, you can show the structure of your website here.**

If you are not sure what types of diagram you need for your project, ask right away.

# **User Interface Wireframe(s)/Screenshot(s)**

**These are meant to show the appearance and structure of your key screens.  If you are developing an app, present these to the scale of the typical phone that you are designing for.   Also provide unique screenID’s, captions and annotations that elaborate on your screens.**

# 

# **Design Summary**

***This is an overview of your design approach (as presented in your Diagram(s).***


# **Design Rationale**

***This is a running list of issues that arise as your design process proceeds. This is an important section of the design document as it captures the thought process of the product's designers. It includes why or why not (rejected solutions) a design decision was made and supports future changes to the product. It should be updated whenever a design change occurs.*** 

***It is RARELY the case that the first design you consider is the best one that you can come up with that meets the requirements and that can be implemented, tested, and delivered on schedule. Your instructor will be looking for signs that you considered at least a few approaches, and that you had a coherent rationale for preferring the design your team eventually adopts.***

***This is the place to record such thoughts – what alternatives did you consider? What are the strengths (and deficiencies) of the final design compared to the other alternatives considered? Why did you select the approach you finally chose? This last question should be answered with an eye to the tradeoffs inevitably involved in creating an appropriate design.***

***In addition, if (not when) the design has to be adjusted to meet unexpected problems or new requirements, this is the place to record what changes were made, what effect these had on the work that had been completed to date, and the rationale for the making changes (as opposed to “just toughing it out”).***
