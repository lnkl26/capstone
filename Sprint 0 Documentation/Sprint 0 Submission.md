## Sprint Accomplishments

### Jesselle Ballesil

### Jack Crawford

### Chet Hefton

During Sprint 0, I mostly contributed through the design process and brainstorming stages of our project. I helped generate and refine potential project ideas by actively engaging in discussions, weighing the feasibility of different approaches, and ensuring that our concepts aligned with both "user needs" and technical constraints. Once we narrowed our focus, I contributed to outlining the structure of our project. By collaborating with teammates during design sessions, I helped provide clarity on how certain features might be implemented and fit together within the project.

Overall, my work in Sprint 0 centered on shaping the foundation of our project through design input and brainstorming, in hopes of giving the team a clear starting point for Sprint 1.

### Leann Kahal

During Sprint 0, I contributed to the team's progress by actively participating in group brainstorming sessions to help refine project ideas. I took the lead when it came to drafting the product requirements and design documentation, ensuring that our planning would align with our project goals and technical feasibility. Communication with our project sponsor was also delegated to me. As I would be the one to ask for clarification and gather additional input to ensure we were meeting expectations. Role delegation was decided by me, as I would consider each member's strengths and availability to give a balanced but logical distribution of work. I also made a deliberate decision to start our brainstorming early in the sprint, as a way to avoid any last-minute efforts. 

Additionally, I attempted to ensure that members would arrive at our sprint meetings on time by sending out reminders. This way, we would keep up the momentum. 

I am content with the amount of work I accomplished in this sprint and look forward to the next sprint.

## AI as a Tool

AI was seldom used due to its known inaccuracies, even when given detailed prompts and resources. So, it was mainly used for quickly generating formatted text. For example, when utilizing the online editor PlantUML, Leann  used ChatGPT to generate the text for the UML class diagram, ER diagram and IA diagram. However, double-checking the text was necessary as ChatGPT may hallucinate terms that shouldn't be used in specific diagrams. Double-checking was necessary to confirm the consistency of the diagrams.

## Reflection

As a team, we were able to contribute ideas openly, because everyone was given an opportunity to voice their thoughts. We had a supportive environment that encouraged creativity at the beginning of our sprint. Attendance and participation of meetings were consistent. Therefore, we were able to have efficient and focused discussions. However, while meetings were productive, members relied too heavily on in-person communication. There were occasional gaps concerning new information and updates. To further improve team efficiency, members should utilize all shared productivity tools such as GitHub and communication channels, as a way to stay informed on project status, regardless of meeting attendance. 

## Next Sprint Goals

We have a couple of goals for Sprint 1 after gathering user stories from our project sponsor and analyzing the results from our user survey. With our first goal being to have a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities available for task management and food logging. If these are completed early, we will begin implementing CRUD functionalities for routine and reminder managment. With that being said, we will also work on implementing our UI design throughout the sprint, and gather user feedback.
