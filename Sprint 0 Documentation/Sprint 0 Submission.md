## Sprint Accomplishments

### Jesselle Ballesil

### Jack Crawford

### Chet Hefton

### Leann Kahal

During Sprint 0, I contributed to the team's progress by actively participating in group brainstorming sessions to help refine project ideas. I took the lead when it came to drafting the product requirements and design documentation, ensuring that our planning would align with our project goals and technical feasibility. Communication with our project sponsor was also delegated to me. As I would be the one to ask for clarification and gather additional input to ensure we were meeting expectations. Role delegation was decided by me, as I would consider each member's strengths and availability to give a balanced but logical distribution of work. I also made a deliberate decision to start our brainstorming early in the sprint, as a way to avoid any last-minute efforts. 

Additionally, I attempted to ensure that members would arrive at our sprint meetings on time by sending out reminders. This way, we would keep up the momentum. 

I am content with the amount of work I accomplished in this sprint and look forward to the next sprint.

## Next Sprint Goals

We have a couple of goals for Sprint 1 after gathering user stories from our project sponsor and analyzing the results from our user survey. With our first goal being to have a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities available for task management and food logging. If these are completed early, we will begin implementing CRUD functionalities for routine and reminder managment. With that being said, we will also work on implementing our UI design throughout the sprint, and gather user feedback.
