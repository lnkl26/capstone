## Notes

10/09/2025 Chet H - In a live hosted / dev environment, service worker fetters CSS, so if the styling looks off while live hosting, re-save your style.css file and it will show what the user would see upon landing.

10/10/2025 | Leann Kahal | GitHub Pages is rather slow to update (compared to running the site locally), so do expect some changes to not fully appear on the "live" site for a bit. This could range from instantantenously to an hour or two.

10/12/2025 | Leann Kahal | Bug #4 is only a visual bug, functionalities works just as intended, therefore this is a low priority fix for now.

10/13/2025 | Jesselle Ballesil | Currently editing a task links to same modal as creating one, so while functionality is fine it still says "Create a new task" in the popup. Will need to eventually create a new modal for editing tasks.

10/14/2025 | Jesselle Ballesil | On iOS, fonts for buttons are colored blue instead of black.

10/14/2025 | Jesselle Ballesil | Resolved bug by making sure closing modal calls resetTaskForm(). May need to review code for redundancies, but the bug is resolved.
